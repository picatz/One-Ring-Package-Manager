  description: Fierce is a semi-lightweight scanner that helps locate non-contiguous

    to nmap, unicornscan, nessus, nikto, etc, since all of those require that you
    already know what IP space you are looking for. This does not perform exploitation
    and does not scan the whole internet indiscriminately. It is meant specifically
    to locate likely targets both inside and outside a corporate network. Because
    it uses DNS primarily you will often find mis-configured networks that leak internal
    address space. That’s especially useful in targeted malware.
